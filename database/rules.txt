Title: WELCOME TO THE BLIND AUDITIONS OF THE VOICE
Rules:
- When a contestant starts his/her performance, the trainers can only hear the contestant sing, but they face away from the stage and are not allowed to WATCH the contestant's performance. 
- Each trainer has a choice to blindly push a button and turn their chair around if they want an artist to be on their team.
- If none of the trainers push their button, the contestant is eliminated.
- If ONE trainer chooses the contestant, the contestant is recruited into that trainer's team.
- If MANY trainers choose the contestant, the decision is the contestant's to choose on which team he/she wants to be.
